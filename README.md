This project is designed to help me make traditionally hand-painted textures for my 3D models in a single contained solution, but I am also trying to make it accessible so that other people who are interested can do the same!

// BASIC USAGE //

On launch the app will detect the default webcam used by the system. Point the camera at a specific canvas with corners marked by a single distinctive colour, then drag the sliders until only those corners are white. If set up properly, you should see your webcam view cropped to only the canvas to the right. If there's an issue you can hit the settings button at the top. To pause/play the webcam view, hit the pause button in the top middle.
